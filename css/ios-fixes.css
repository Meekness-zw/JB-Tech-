/* iOS / touch-device scroll fixes for the home page
 *
 * Goal:
 * - Override aggressive overflow: hidden on home screens that can freeze
 *   scrolling on iOS when the custom scroll engine fails to initialize.
 * - Limit changes to touch-like devices (pointer: coarse / no hover) and
 *   to the home page only (body.page-id-home).
 */

    overflow-y: auto !important;
    overflow-x: hidden;
